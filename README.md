  Minimal Portfolio Page Built with React
</h3>

## Why?
One fine day i was going through GitHub and found an awesome concept on [Sameer Faridi's Profile](https://github.com/sameerkali/) and saw that people really liked it and so did i. I really liked the minimalist approach and hence thought that i should take it a step forward. 

Actually the original repo has some static files in which you need to manually go and edit the source code in order to get your landing page up and running. So i have bootstrapped the same content with create-react-app, i.e **REACTJS**. Now you only need to change one config file, run couple of commands and that's it. 

## What's Included ?

Well you never know whats coming in future, but as of now it supports :

- Material Background with Dark and Light Mode toggle with a button click

  
-  Each Dark as well as Light Mode supports 7 color combos by default. (Total -14)


- Background Changes as and when you click anywhere on page.
- Gradient Background Support with Free Flow Animation 

## Found Interesting ?
Please star the repo if found useful as it'll help other devs to react the content. And yes **feel free to fork, clone, play around and make your own version .**

## How about Contributing ?
**Branch out the repo and customize on top. If your changes awe us, we will for sure merge them back to the repo**.
