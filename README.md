## Why?
One fine day i was going through GitHub and found an awesome concept on [Dinesh Pandiyan's Profile](https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page) and saw that people really liked it and so did i. I really liked the minimalist approach and hence thought that i should take it a step forward. 

Actually the original repo has some static files in which you need to manually go and edit the source code in order to get your landing page up and running. So i have bootstrapped the same content with create-react-app, i.e **REACTJS**. Now you only need to change one config file, run couple of commands and that's it. 

## What's Included ?

Well you never know whats coming in future, but as of now it supports :

- Material Background with Dark and Light Mode toggle with a button click

-  Each Dark as well as Light Mode supports 7 color combos by default. (Total -14)
